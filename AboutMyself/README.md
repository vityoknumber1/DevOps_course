# Greetings!
  ========== 

My name is Viktor, I live in Kyiv. 1,5 years ago graduated from *Kyiv Polytechnic Institute*, speciality **"Cybersecurity"**. Meanwhile I work as a system administrator in hosting company, and I try to receive new skills in DevOps sphere.

### This course is interesting to me because:

+ Individual and program work is practiced;
+ Is possible to study the DevOps methodology in details;
+ New and interesting experience.

### I expect from this course:

+ Improving my Linux knowledge;
+ Learning of CI/CD practices;
+ Possibility of internship and employment.
